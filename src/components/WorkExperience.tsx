                <p> As a Summer Intern at KPMG Taiwan in Hsinchu City, I had the opportunity to work in a fast-paced,
                    professional environment,
                    gaining valuable hands-on experience in auditing and financial reporting. Collaborating with senior
                    auditors,
                    I assisted in organizing annual IFRS financial statements, preparing detailed audit working papers,
                    and proofreading English
                    financial statements to ensure accuracy and compliance with financial regulations.<br/>
                    <br/>Beyond technical accounting tasks, this internship sharpened my analytical thinking,
                    problem-solving abilities,
                    and attention to detail. I developed a stronger understanding of financial regulations and audit
                    procedures, while also enhancing
                    my ability to work under tight deadlines and maintain high professional standards.<br/>
                    <br/>This experience reinforced my interest in financial auditing and compliance, equipping me with
                    the skills necessary for a future career
                    in the accounting and finance industry.
