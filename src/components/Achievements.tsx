                <p> As a leader in MEDlife Moscrop, I <strong>fundraised $829</strong> for MEDlife by designing and
                    selling custom pins (Taiwan)
                    and bracelets (Canada). Additionally, I <strong>collaborated with eight other Moscrop
                        students</strong> to coordinate fundraising events,
                    promote global health awareness, and support MEDlife’s mission. </p>
